# smsbot-cc
- Build a currency converter service using RingCentral SMS framework.
- This demo project shows how to use RingCentral SMS and Push Notification APIs to implement a SMS bot. The bot will listen for incoming SMS text commands then reply to the sender with relevant content.
- Text commands:
* __?__ Or __help__ for getting instructions.
* __symbol/n__ for getting a list of foreign currency symbols, where n is the first alphabet of a countryâ€™s name.
* __base/target__ for getting a current exchange rate, where target is the currency symbol to be quoted against the base currency symbol.

# Setup
```
git clone https://github.com/pacovu/smsbot-cc
cd smsbot-cc
npm intall --save
```
- Rename the dotenv to .env and provide your app credentials, RingCentral sandbox account's username and password
- Replace this "YOUR_WEBSERVER_POST_HOOK_OR_NGROK_FORWARDING" with your webhook address
*** If you run the app in a localhost, you can use [ngrok](https://gist.github.com/wosephjeber/aa174fb851dfe87e644e) ***
